# EmacsforStatistics

Emacs Fast Start
----------------
(process copied from https://github.com/squiter/emacs-fast-start/blob/master/README.md)

## Installation

Before start, make sure that you don't have `.emacs` and `.emacs.d` in your home directory:

```
ls -la ~/ | grep emacs
```

This command shouldn't return anything!

Since you don't have any files in your home directory, let's begin!  

#### Clone the repo:

```
git clone git@github.com:gabriben/EmacsforStatistics
```

Then enter in repo directory:

```
cd EmacsforStatistics
```

Then make it:

```
make
```

This will copy `.emacs` and `.emacs.d` to your home directory.

Ok, that's it! :)
