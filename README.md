Emacs Fast Start
----------------
(process copied from https://github.com/squiter/emacs-fast-start/blob/master/README.md)

This repo is proposed to help users to start using Emacs editor. In this code I choose the essential packages and configurations to have a happy start with this amazing editor.

## Installation

Before start, make sure that you don't have `.emacs` and `.emacs.d` in your home directory:

```
ls -la ~/ | grep emacs
```

This command shouldn't return anything!

Since you don't have any files in your home directory, let's begin!  

#### Clone the repo:

```
git@github.com:squiter/emacs-fast-start.git
```

Then enter in repo directory:

```
cd emacs-fast-start
```

Then make it:

```
make
```

This will copy `.emacs` and `.emacs.d` to your home directory.

Ok, that's it! :)
